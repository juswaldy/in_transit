scripture has been fulﬁlled. 13 But
now I am coming to you, and I
am speaking these things in the
world in order that they may have
my Joy in themselves to the full.
14 I have given your word to them,
but the world has hated them,
because they are no part of the
world, just as I am no part of the
world.

15 “I request you, not to take
them out of the world, but to watch
over them because of the Wicked
one. 16 They are no part of the
world, just as I am no part of the
world. 17 Sanctify them by means
of the truth; your word is truth.
18 Just as you sent me forth into
the world, I also sent them forth
into the world. 19 And I am
sanctifying myself in their behalf,
that they also may be sanctiﬁed
by means of truth.

20 “I make request, not concern—
ing these only, but also concerning
those putting faith in me through
their word; 21 in order that they
may all be one, just as you, Father,
are in union with me and I am in
union with you, that, they also may
be in union with us, in order that
the world may believe that you sent
me forth. 22 Also, I have given
them the glory that you have given
me, in order that they may be one
just as we are one. 23 I in union
with them and you in union with
me, in order that they may be per-
fected into one, that the world
may have the knowledge that you
sent me forth and that you loved
them just as you loved me. 24 Fa-
ther, as to what you have given
me, I wish that, where I am, they
also may be with me, in order to
behold my glory that you have
given me, because you loved me be-
fore the founding of the world.
25 Righteous Father, the world has,
indeed, not come to know you ; but
I have come to know you, and
these have come to know that you
sent me forth. 26 And I have
made your name known to them
and Will make it known, in order
that the love with which you leved
me may be in them and I in union
with them.”

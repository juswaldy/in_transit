The Church Fathers did not enjoy their religion. Foxe’s Boob
of Martyrs shows what their religion cost them. They did not ew.
pect an easy time of it. It was Charles Wesley (1707-1788) in his
marvelous hymn “Soldiers of Christ, Arise” that set the tone for

his generation:

Soldiers of Christ, arise

And put your armor on,

Strong in the strength which God supplies,
Through His eternal Son.

Strong in the Lord of Hosts,

And in That mighty power,

Who in the strength of Jesus trusts

Is more than a conqueror.

Where are these “soldiers of Christ” today? Where are those
who go forth in the “strength which God supplies”? Where are
those who are willing to go forth conquering and to conquer?

The tragedy of this generation of Christians 1s that men
have crept in unawares, as prophesied by Paul in the book of Ro-
mans, and by Jude in his epistle. We have lowered our guard, and
these false prophets have so positioned themselves that they are
controlling the destiny of this generation's Christian Church.

Overtaken by Spiritually
Impotent Theologians
Another tragedy I associate with today’s evangelical church is
the fact that we have been overtaken and held hostage by spitt-
tually impotent theologians. I love the word “theology.” It sim-
— the study of God; and there is nothing greater to
‘ue in this world. Our hearts hunger for God, asking when

 

THE DANGERS OF A SHALLOW FAITH

heart for his community. Celebrities are now leading us, by;

they are not leading us down the same pathway the Fathers of
the Church established.

‘The Spirit of Lethargy

All of this has successfully created in today’s evangelical church
a condition of spiritual lethargy. Because the word “lethargy”
is not in common use, I probably need to outline a little bit of
what I mean.

By lethargy, I mean living on yesterday's momentum. That
seems to explain the condition today. The Church Fathers did
not look back and try to live in the past. The Church Fathers
looked back to find their compass so they could go forward in
the power and demonstration of the Holy Spirit.

If we do not know where we have been, how in the world
are we going to determine where we are going? That is the
only reason for looking back. We do not look back in order to
go back. Rather, we look back so that we can make sure we are
going forward in the right direction.

The Spirit of Ease
Too many in the Church today are living on yesterday’s mo-
mentum. They feel that all of the battles have been fought.
They assume that all the struggles in the Church are over.
They are the privileged generation that goes to heaven on
flowery beds of ease.

Probably the most discouraging aspect of this is that many
have grown accustomed to a static condition and have suc-
cumbed to a spirit of non-expectation. The only expectation
most have is that when they die they fully expect to 5° ©
heaven. Apart from that, they are going to spend their time
having fun and enjoying their religion.

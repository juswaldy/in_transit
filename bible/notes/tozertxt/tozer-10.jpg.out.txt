THE DANGERS OF A SHALLOW FAITH

Then, from the word “theology” comes the word “theolo.
gian.” It used to mean a person who has specialized in the
study of God, but it has come to mean someone who is an ex.
pert in a slice of Christianity. In many cases that slice is rather
small and disassociated from the whole.

These contemporary theologians deal with doctrinal minu-
tia. Their expertise is in the area of rethinking doctrinal posi-
tions in light of contemporary society and culture. For some
reason, they believe that because society has changed so dras-
tically, our doctrinal positions need to change accordingly. To
reexamine the doctrine of the inspiration of Scripture, for ex-
ample, is an exercise in futility.

By slicing and dicing doctrinal positions, we have come to
a point of not knowing what we believe. Not only that, but we
also need new translations of the Scripture. I am not against
that at all. Every time a new translation is published, Iam one
of the first to purchase it.

However, a new, updated translation of the Scripture is
not the answer. It is amazing that in a generation of Chris-
tians with more modern translations of the Scriptures than all
the other generations put together, it is just about the weak-

est group of Christians we have ever seen.

It is not by reading the Scriptures in the original languages
or in some contemporary version that makes us better Chris-
tians. Rather, it is getting on our knees with the Scriptures

spread before us, and allowing the Spirit of God to break our
hearts. Then, when we have been thoroughly broken before
God Almighty, we get up off our knees, go out into the world

and proclaim the glorious message of Jesus Christ, the Savior

 

of the world. —

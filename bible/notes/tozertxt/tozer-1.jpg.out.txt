AT THE BRINK
OF APOSTASY

Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such
turn away. For of this sort are they which creep into houses, and lead
captive silly women laden with sins, led away with divers lusts, ever
learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.

2 TIMOTHY 335-/

The evangelical church in America is facing some serious haz-
ards that threaten to bring it to the brink of apostasy. My
prayer is that it 1s not Coo late for an awakening that will lead
to successful reformation.

My use of the term “evangelical” includes all churches that
are fundamental, full Gospel, holiness, Anabaptist and Pente-
costal—all evangelical churches that believe the Bible and pro-
claim Jesus Christ to be the only Savior of the world. I have
nothing to say to any other church.

It is amazing to me how divided is the evangell
America, which reminds me of my mother’s old-fashioned ap-
ple pie. No matter how thin you slice the pie, every slice believes
it is better than the rest of the pie. Even though the “pie” 1n-
cludes the same ingredients, goes through the same process
and bakes in the same oven, each piece feels superior to the
Other piece.

aring-Gould (1834-1924) says it as it ought to be:

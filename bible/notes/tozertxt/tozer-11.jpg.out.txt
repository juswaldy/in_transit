know is what are they expert in? It does not seem that many
of them are expert in knowing God as the Fathers knew God.
They do not seem to have that overwhelming awe that was
predominant in the Early Church movement. What have our
experts done for the Church except to push it into a rut, allow-
ing the letter of the law to dominate and control while deny-
ing the power of the Holy Spirit? I fear that we may have
become too apologetic with our apologetics, and in trying to
please everyone we end up destroying the truth.

This has created a religious class system. All these learned
doctors with their PhDs and their noses firmly pointed north
have caused great strife in the Church of Jesus Christ. Don’t
they know that the devil is a better theologian than all of us
put together? The Scriptures tell us that the devil even trem-
bles before God, but he has no part in God’s kingdom: “Thou
believest that there is one God; thou doest well: the devils also
believe, and tremble” (Jas. 2:19).

This only shows the tyranny of religion today. In the
Early Church, everybody was part of the ministry team. Every-
body was expected to go out into the world and preach the
glorious redeeming message of Jesus Christ. Certainly, there
were categories—such as elders and bishops and apostles. The
Church ran quite efficiently by all Christians working to-
gether, each of them knowing where they belonged, and do-
ing their part.

Now we have teams of experts who only know the letter of
the law. We have people who have become religious snobs put-
ting on a show for Christians in the hopes that the Sunday of-
fering would be more than sufficient to subsidize a lifestyle of
greed. It is not hard to see that a spirit of Babylon creating a
condition of spiritual lethargy has invaded today’s Church—

all of this orchestrated by spiritually impotent theologians.

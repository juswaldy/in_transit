The Bible has a message for the evangelical church, calling it

back home. The Bible always sends us out into the world, but

one direction.
So, my Christian friend, if you are settling back, snuggling

into your foam rubber chair and resting in your faith in John
3-16 and the fact that you have accepted Jesus Christ, you had
better watch yourself. Take heed, lest you also be found want-
ing. Take heed of your own heart, lest when all is said and done,
have become tied in with the world.

In looking back over the history of Israel in the Old Testa-
ment, I cannot help but note that just about every third gener-
ation had to throw out all the previous generation’s religious
accouterments and get back to the original. It started with the
Fathers who established their nation upon the clear Word of
the Lord. The sons of the Fathers began taking that foundation
for granted, adding nonessential elements while allowing cru-
ial and fundamental essentials to slide. In the grandsons, we
find a complete disregard for the grandfathers who established
Israel, completely disenfranchising the entire nation of Israel
from its foundation and completely disregarding the prophets’
warning: “Remove not the ancient landmark, which thy fathers
have set” (Prov. 22:28).

They sought other gods that suited their fancy at the time.
They looked with envy at the nations around them and began
adopting the pagan gods of their neighbors. Soon they also
adopted the culture of the nations around them, and it was dif-
ficult to tell the difference between an Israelite and a Philistine.

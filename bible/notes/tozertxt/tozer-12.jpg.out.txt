Must Jesus Bear the Cross Alone
Thomas Shepherd (1665-1739)
a eeeeeeeeeeSFsFseesese
Must Jesus bear the cross alone
And all the world go free?
No, there’s a cross for everyone
And there’s a cross for me.

How happy are the saints above
Who once went sorrowing here!
But now they taste unmingled love
And joy without a tear.

The consecrated cross I’ll bear
Till death shall set me free
And then go home my crown to wear

  

For there’s a crown for me.

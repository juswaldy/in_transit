\songtitle{Psalm 92}
\begin{verbatim}


It is good to give thanks to the LORD

To sing praise to your name O Most High

To declare your steadfast love in the morning, and your

Faithfulness by night


To the music of the lute and the harp, to the

Melody of the lyre

At the works of your hands

I sing for joy


A song, a song for the Sabbath

You have made me glad by your work

A song, a song for the Sabbath

O LORD how great are your works

O LORD how great are your works



Very deep are your thoughts O LORD

The stupid man cannot know

The fool cannot understand this

He cannot know


Though the wicked sprout like grass

Evildoers all flourish

They are doomed to destruction forever

But you are forever on high


Behold, your enemies, LORD

Your enemies shall perish

All evildoers, behold

They shall be scattered

But you have exalted my horn

Like the horn of the wild ox

Fresh oil over me you have poured

You have poured over me


My ears have heard the doom of my evil assailants

My ears have heard

The downfall of my enemies

My eyes have seen


The righteous flourish like the palm tree

Like cedars in Lebanon grow

They flourish in the courts of our God

Planted in the house of the LORD

Planted in the house of the LORD


They still bear fruit in old age

Ever full of sap and green

To declare the LORD is upright

My rock is he


In him there is no unrighteousness

In him there is no unrighteousness

No unrighteousness

The LORD is upright

My rock is he

A song...
The righteous...

\songtitle{God's Rest}

\begin{verbatim}

In the beginning God said let there be light, day and night

In the beginning God made heaven and earth, sky and sea

In the beginning God created man and beast, birds and trees


Shabbat Shalom

God rested, he rested on the seventh day

Shabbat Shalom

God rested, he rested on the seventh day


In the wilderness God sent the cloud and fire, day and night

In the wilderness God gave them meat to eat, quail for food

In the wilderness God gave them daily bread, manna from heaven


Shabbat Shalom...


He promised us his rest

He has given us his son


Shabbat Shalom...

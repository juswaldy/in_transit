\songtitle{Here I am to Worship}
\begin{verbatim}
by Tim Hughes

Light of the world
You stepped down into darkness
Opened my eyes, let me see
Beauty that made
This heart adore You
Hope of a life spent with you

Here I am to worship
Here I am to bow down
Here I am to say that you're my God
You're altogether lovely
Altogether worthy
Altogether wonderful to me

King of all days
Oh so highly exalted
Glorious in heaven above
Humbly you came
To the earth you created
All for love's sake became poor

Here I am to worhip...

I'll never know how much it cost
To see my sin upon that cross (4x)

Here I am to worhip...

\end{verbatim}

\songtitle{Bless the Lord, Oh My Soul}
\begin{verbatim}
by Jonas Myrin & Matt Redman

Bless the Lord oh my soul, oh my soul
Worship his holy name
Sing like never before, oh my soul
I'll worship your holy name

The sun comes up, it's a new day dawning
It's time to sing your song again
Whatever may pass, and whatever lies before me
Let me be singing when the evening comes

Bless the Lord oh my soul...

You're rich in love, and you're slow to anger
Your name is great, and your heart is kind
For all your goodness I will keep on singing
Ten thousand reasons for my heart to find

Bless the Lord oh my soul...

And on that day when my strength is failing
The end draws near, and my time has come
Still my soul will sing your praise unending
Ten thousand years and then forevermore

Bless the Lord oh my soul...
Bless the Lord oh my soul...

\end{verbatim}

\songtitle{It is Well with My Soul}
\begin{verbatim}
by C. C. Stafford

When peace like a river, attendeth my way
When sorrows like sea billows roll
Whatever my lot, thou hast taught me to say
It is well, it is well, with my soul

It is well
With my soul
It is well
It is well with my soul

Though Satan should buffet, though trials should come
Let this blest assurance control
That Christ has regarded my helpless estate
And hath shed His own blood for my soul

It is well (it is well)
With my soul (with my soul)
It is well
It is well with my soul

My sin, oh, the bliss of this glorious thought
My sin, not in part but the whole
Is nailed to the cross, and I bear it no more
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, o my soul

It is well (it is well)...

\end{verbatim}

\songtitle{Beautiful Things}
\begin{verbatim}
by Lisa & Michael Gungor

All this pain
I wonder if I'll ever find my way
I wonder if my life could really change
At all?

All this earth
Could all that is lost ever be found?
Could a garden come up from this ground
At all?

You make beautiful things
You make beautiful things out of the dust
You make beautiful things
You make beautiful things out of us

All around
Hope is springing up from this old ground
Out of chaos life is being found
In you

You make beautiful things...
You make beautiful things...

You make me new
You are making me new
You make me new
You are making me new

\end{verbatim}

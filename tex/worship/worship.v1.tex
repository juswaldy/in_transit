\songtitle{You Are My All In All}
\begin{verbatim}
by Dennis Jernigan

You are my strength when I am weak
You are the treasure that I seek
You are my all in all
Seeking you as a precious jewel
Lord to give up I'd be a fool
You are my all in all

Jesus, Lamb of God
Worthy is your name
Jesus, Lamb of God
Worthy is your name

Taking my sin my cross my shame
Rising again I bless your name
You are my all in all
When I fall down you pick me up
When I am dry you fill my cup
You are my all in all

Jesus, Lamb of God...

\songtitle{Worthy, You Are Worthy}
\begin{verbatim}
by Matt Redman

Worthy, you are worthy
Much more worthy than I know
I cannot imagine
Just how glorious you are
I cannot begin to tell
How deep a love you bring
Lord, my ears have heard of you
But now my eyes have seen

You're worthy 3x
You're worthy to be praised
Forever and a day

You're worthy 3x
You're worthy to be praised
Forever and a day

Glory, I give glory
To the one who saved my soul
You found me and you freed me
From the shame that was my own
I cannot begin to tell
How merciful you've been
Lord, my ears had heard of you
But now my eyes have seen
 
You're worthy...

\songtitle{The Father's Song}
\begin{verbatim}
by Matt Redman

I have heard so many songs
Listened to a thousand tongues
But there is one that sounds above them all
The Father's song, the Father's love
You sung it over me, and for
Eternity it's written on my heart

Heaven's perfect melody
The Creator's symphony
You are singing over me
The Father's song

Heaven's perfect mystery
The King of Love has sent for me
Now you're singing over me
The Father's song

\end{verbatim}

\songtitle{Psalm 103:8-18}
\begin{verbatim}
by David son of Jesse

The LORD is merciful and gracious,
    slow to anger and abounding in steadfast love.
He will not always chide,
    nor will he keep his anger forever.
He does not deal with us according to our sins,
    nor repay us according to our iniquities.
For as high as the heavens are above the earth,
    so great is his steadfast love toward those who fear him;
as far as the east is from the west,
    so far does he remove our transgressions from us.
As a father shows compassion to his children,
    so the LORD shows compassion to those who fear him.
For he knows our frame;
    he remembers that we are dust.

As for man, his days are like grass;
    he flourishes like a flower of the field;
for the wind passes over it, and it is gone,
    and its place knows it no more.
But the steadfast love of the LORD
    is from everlasting to everlasting
	on those who fear him,
and his righteousness to children's children,
to those who keep his covenant
    and remember to do his commandments.

Psalm 92

It is good to give thanks to the LORD
To sing praise to your name O Most High
To declare your steadfast love in the morning, and your
Faithfulness by night

To the music of the lute and the harp, to the
Melody of the lyre
At the works of your hands
I sing for joy

A song, a song for the Sabbath
You have made me glad by your work
A song, a song for the Sabbath
O LORD how great are your works
O LORD how great are your works

Very deep are your thoughts O LORD
The stupid man cannot know
The fool cannot understand this
He cannot know

Though the wicked sprout like grass
Evildoers all flourish
They are doomed to destruction forever
But you are forever on high

Behold, your enemies, LORD
Your enemies shall perish
All evildoers, behold
They shall be scattered
But you have exalted my horn
Like the horn of the wild ox
Fresh oil over me you have poured
You have poured over me

My ears have heard the doom of my evil assailants
My ears have heard
The downfall of my enemies
My eyes have seen

The righteous flourish like the palm tree
Like cedars in Lebanon grow
They flourish in the courts of our God
Planted in the house of the LORD
Planted in the house of the LORD

They still bear fruit in old age
Ever full of sap and green
To declare the LORD is upright
My rock is he

In him there is no unrighteousness
In him there is no unrighteousness
No unrighteousness
The LORD is upright
My rock is he

A song...

The righteous...

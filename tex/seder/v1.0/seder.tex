\chapter{Introduction}

Why?\\
\\
Why we Chinese/Indonesian people be doing these weird Jewish people things?\\
\\
A couple of reasons:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item{
		Because the Passover traditions are beautiful and they point to our savior Jesus ("Yeshua").
		\quot{Behold, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world! (John 1:29)}
	}
	\item{
		Because Yeshua himself celebrated Passover and went through the liturgy.
		\quot{They are Israelites, and to them belong the adoption, the glory, the covenants, the giving of the law, the worship, and the promises. (Romans 9:4)}
	}
	\item{
		Because what we call "communion" at church is actually a couple elements from the Passover liturgy.
		\quot{For I received from the Lord what I also delivered to you, that the Lord Jesus on the night when he was betrayed took bread, and when he had given thanks, he broke it, and said, "This is my body which is for you. Do this in remembrance of me." In the same way also he took the cup, after supper, saying, "This cup is the new covenant in my blood. Do this, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of me." (1 Corinthians 11:23-25)}
	}
	\item{
		Because the Exodus was experienced by non-Jewish people also.
		\quot{A mixed multitude also went up with them... (Exodus 12:38)}
	}
	\item{
		Because it is weird even to the Jewish people.
		\quot{And when you come to the land that the Lord will give you, as he has promised, you shall keep this service. And when your children say to you, "What do you mean by this service?" you shall say, "It is the sacrifice of the Lord's Passover, for he passed over the houses of the people of Israel in Egypt, when he struck the Egyptians but spared our houses." (Exodus 12:26-27)}
	}
	\item{
		Because the Passover is the first proper commandment of God to his people.
		\quot{This day shall be for you a memorial day, and you shall keep it as a feast to the Lord; throughout your generations, as a statute forever, you shall keep it as a feast. (Exodus 12:14)}
	}
\end{enumerate}


\section{The Feast}
The Passover Meal is the most commonly celebrated Jewish feast. It is called the "Seder". It is the meal of Yeshua's "Last Supper" with his disciples.

\quot{And when the hour came, he reclined at table, and the apostles with him. And he said to them, "I have earnestly desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer. For I tell you I will not eat it until it is fulfilled in the kingdom of God." (Luke 22:14-15)}


\section{The Rhyme}

The Seder liturgy is summarized in a nice little rhyme that spells out the order of the whole meal. Each of these little words signifies a step in the order.\\
\\
Qaddesh Urchatz, Karpas Yachatz\\
Maggid Rachtza, Motzi Mattza\\
Maror Korekh, Shulchan Orekh\\
Tzafun Barekh, Hallel Nirtza


\section{The Liturgy}

We are doing a simplified liturgy, instead of a full-fledged one. Many items have been removed from the traditional liturgy for reasons of time and my own ignorance. Sorry =)\\
\\
Items needed for the liturgy:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item{Two candles}
	\item{Grape juice or wine}
	\item{Unleavened bread or Matzah}
	\item{A white cloth to wrap the unleavened bread}
	\item{A napkin to hide the Afikomen}
	\item{A washing bowl or basin}
	\item{A green vegetable, e.g. celery or parsley: representing fertility and growth}
	\item{A bitter herb, e.g. horseradish: representing the bitterness of slavery}
	\item{A bowl of salt water or vinegar: representing sweat and tears during slavery, also representing the Red Sea}
\end{enumerate}

\vspace{5mm}

\noindent Let's begin the liturgy.\\
\\
Eldest Woman: Let the eldest woman in the house light up two candles. (Usually every Sabbath, the youngest female in the house lights up the candles. But for Passover, it's the eldest woman.)\\

\chapter{Qaddesh: Sanctify} 
Step \thechapter: Sanctifying the wine.\\
\\
The Qiddush ("Sanctification") is a Sabbath blessing recited over wine or grape juice. It's recited weekly to sanctify the Sabbath, but also on Jewish holidays. The Shehecheyanu ("Who has given us life") is a blessing recited during special occasions, e.g. the beginning of a holiday or feast.

The Qiddush:\\

\recite{Leader}{And there was evening and there was morning, the sixth day. Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them. And on the seventh day God finished his work that he had done, and he rested on the seventh day from all his work that he had done. So God blessed the seventh day and sanctified it, because on it God rested from all his work that he had done in creation.}

\recite{All}{Blessed are you O LORD our God, king of the universe, creator of the fruit of the vine.}

\recite{All}{[Pour a little wine for the person sitting to your left.]}

\recite{Leader}{Blessed are you O LORD our God, king of the universe, who sanctified us with his commandments, and was pleased with us, and invested us with his holy Sabbath in love and favor, as a memorial of the Creation. For it is foremost among the holy festivals commemorating the exodus from Egypt. For you chose us and sanctified us, out of all the peoples, and you invested us with your holy Sabbath in love and favor. Blessed are you O LORD, who sanctifies the Sabbath.}

\recite{All}{Amen.}

\chapter{Urchatz: And Wash}
Step \thechapter: Washing the hands.\\

\textbf{All: [Pour water over the hands of the person to your right.]}

\quot{Yeshua, knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands, and that he had come from God and was going back to God, rose from supper. He laid aside his outer garments, and taking a towel, tied it around his waist. Then he poured water into a basin and began to wash the disciples' feet and to wipe them with the towel that was wrapped around him.\\
\\
He came to Simon Peter, who said to him, "Lord, do you wash my feet?" Yeshua answered him, "What I am doing you do not understand now, but afterward you will understand." Peter said to him, "You shall never wash my feet." Yeshua answered him, "If I do not wash you, you have no share with me." Simon Peter said to him, "Lord, not my feet only but also my hands and my head!"\\
\\
Yeshua said to him, "The one who has bathed does not need to wash, except for his feet, but is completely clean. And you are clean, but not every one of you." For he knew who was to betray him; that was why he said, "Not all of you are clean." When he had washed their feet and put on his outer garments and resumed his place, he said to them, “Do you understand what I have done to you?.. (John 13:3-12)}

\chapter{The Door}
<Exodus 12:7>
\quot{Then they shall take some of the blood and put it on the two doorposts and the lintel of the houses in which they eat it.}

\noindent...the blood...

\quot{So Jesus again said to them, "Truly, truly, I say to you, I am the door of the sheep."}

\noindent...the door...\\
...the way...

\quot{"I am the way, and the truth, and the life."}

\noindent...the life...

\quot{For the life of every creature is its blood: its blood is its life. Therefore I have said to the people of Israel, You shall not eat the blood of any creature, for the life of every creature is its blood. Whoever eats it shall be cut off.}

\quot{For the life of the flesh is in the blood, and I have given it for you on the altar to make atonement for your souls, for it is the blood that makes atonement by the life.}

\noindent...the life...is in the blood...\\
...without the blood, there is no life...\\
...without the blood, there is no atonement...\\
...without the blood, the door is just the door, it is not the way...\\
...but with the blood, the door becomes the way, the gate...\\

\noindent...the way...the way to where?

\quot{Jesus said to him, "I am the way, and the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me."}

\noindent...the way to the Father...

\quot{Then you shall say to Pharaoh, 'Thus says the LORD, Israel is my firstborn son,  and I say to you, "Let my son go that he may serve me."'}

\noindent...that the son...may go to the Father...\\
...that the sheep...may go find pasture...

\quot{Know that the LORD, he is God!\\
\hspace*{5mm}It is he who made us, and we are his;\\
\hspace*{5mm}we are his people, and the sheep of his pasture.}

\quot{For he is our God,\\
\hspace*{5mm}and we are the people of his pasture,\\
\hspace*{5mm}and the sheep of his hand.}

\quot{Today, if you hear his voice,...}

\quot{I will surely assemble all of you, O Jacob;\\
\hspace*{5mm}I will gather the remnant of Israel;\\
I will set them together\\
\hspace*{5mm}like sheep in a fold,\\
like a flock in its pasture,\\
\hspace*{5mm}a noisy multitude of men.}

\quot{He who opens the breach goes up before them;\\
\hspace*{5mm}they break through and pass the gate,\\
\hspace*{5mm}going out by it.\\
Their king passes on before them,\\
\hspace*{5mm}the LORD at their head.}

\quot{"To him the gatekeeper opens. The sheep hear his voice, and he calls his own sheep by name and leads them out."}

\quot{Moses spoke to the LORD, saying, "Let the Lord, the God of the spirits of all flesh, appoint a man over the congregation who shall go out before them and come in before them, who shall lead them out and bring them in, that the congregation of the LORD may not be as sheep that have no shepherd."\\
\\
So the LORD said to Moses, "Take Joshua the son of Nun, a man in whom is the Spirit, and lay your hand on him.\\
\\
And he shall stand before Eleazar the priest, who shall inquire for him by the judgment of the Urim before the Lord. At his word they shall go out, and at his word they shall come in, both he and all the people of Israel with him, the whole congregation."}

\quot{"I am the door. If anyone enters by me, he will be saved and will go in and out and find pasture."}

\quot{Only be sure that you do not eat the blood, for the blood is the life, and you shall not eat the life with the flesh. Deut 12:23}

\quot{So Jesus said to them, "Truly, truly, I say to you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you have no life in you." John 6:53}

\quot{And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us...}

\quot{"Man shall not live by bread alone,\\
\hspace*{5mm}but by every word that comes from the mouth of God."}

\quot{"I am the living bread that came down from heaven. If anyone eats of this bread, he will live forever. And the bread that I will give for the life of the world is my flesh."}

\quot{They shall eat the flesh that night, roasted on the fire; with unleavened bread and bitter herbs they shall eat it.}
<Exodus 12:8>
